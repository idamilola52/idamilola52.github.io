## Overview

Vulnerability Assessment is the process of systematically identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing security weaknesses in a system or network. It involves using tools like Nmap to discover open ports and services, as well as platforms like Nessus to detect misconfigurations, outdated software, and potential vulnerabilities.

This assessment helps in understanding the security posture of the target environment, providing insights into exploitable weaknesses that attackers might leverage. In this lab, the goal was to identify hidden information on a target web server and capture four specific flags.

## Lab Environment

* **Target URL:** `http://target.ine.local`
* **Nessus Dashboard:** `https://localhost:8834/`
* **Credentials:** `admin` / `adminpasswd`

### Objective
Identify the services running on the machine, perform a detailed vulnerability scan, and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

## Phase 1: Host Discovery & Enumeration

To begin the lab, I performed host discovery by pinging the target machine to confirm connectivity.

### Port Scanning with Nmap
Subsequently, an Nmap scan was executed to identify open ports and services on the target machine. The scan results indicated that ports **80 (HTTP)** and **3306 (MySQL)** were open, providing the necessary details for further investigation.

### Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus
Since Port 80 was open, I performed a Nessus web application scan to check for web vulnerabilities. The scan was initiated by logging in with the provided credentials.

## Phase 2: Exploitation & Flag Capture
Flag 1: Hidden Version Control Directory
Discovery: The flag was discovered by exploiting a hidden .git directory, which was revealed during the enumeration phase. Version control directories often contain sensitive project history and artifacts.

Exploitation: Navigating to `http://target.ine.local/.git` allowed access to the directory listing where I found the flag file.

Flag: FLAG1_a4403a27d0fb43009cd12623775d0f12


Flag 2: Unprotected Database Interface
Discovery: Flag 2 was obtained by combining two pieces of information:

The open MySQL port (3306) revealed by the Nmap scan.

The /phpmyadmin directory found in robots.txt (or via common directory brute-forcing).

Exploitation: This led to an unprotected phpMyAdmin portal. I located the flag by navigating the interface to the secret info table within the mysql database.

Flag: FLAG2_49be75ea2fb749d88c9f0f432deda188

Flag 3: Information Disclosure (PHPInfo)
Discovery: Flag 3 was discovered by analyzing the results of the Nessus vulnerability scan. A "Web Server Info.php / phpinfo.php Detection" vulnerability was identified.

Exploitation: Navigating to `http://target.ine.local/phpinfo.php` revealed the PHP configuration page. I searched the page (Ctrl+F) and extracted the flag from the configuration details.

Flag:FLAG3_65b4c5dddddd462fbbb738bddc9a5e40

Flag 4: Sensitive Directory via Robots.txt
Discovery: The final flag was acquired by checking the robots.txt file. This file is used to instruct search engine crawlers on which pages not to visit, which ironically often points attackers toward sensitive hidden directories.

Exploitation: The file revealed a disallowed entry for /passwords. I manually navigated to `http://target.ine.local/passwords` and retrieved the final flag.
